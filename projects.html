        For me projects tend to be a way to solve personal problems or
        understand a topic at a more deeper level.

      <p>
        A toy interpreter written and tested in JavaScript with the aid of the
        book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. Obvious
        functionalities such as let statements, conditional statements and
        functions are supported. For data types string, array and hash are
        supported.

        ## Twitch prediction -

          href="https://github.com/sangshrestha/twitch-prediction"
          target="_blank"
          >Github</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This serves as a bookmarklet to automate betting done with virtual
        channel points on twitch.

      <p>
        This is a product of a take home test for a job application process.
        Carousel on the main page fetches images and the text data from an api.
        Also the contact form sends a POST request to an api for validation. You
        can also download the feedback provided by the company.

        ## YouTube Subscription Manager -

      <p>
        Another project that was born to solve my own frustration of not being
        able to properly manage all of my 500+ channels I was subscribed to on
        YouTube. By researching through the YouTube api documentations, I was
        able to create the functionality to list all the channels alphabetically
        as well as in order of when they last uploaded the video.

        ## Sainsbury clone -
        <a href="https://mimifly.github.io/sainsburys-clone/#/" target="_blank"
          >Site</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a special project for me because it marked the moment when I
        realised I am good enough to do this and can provide value to others
        with my skills. I used ReactJS as well as Google's firebase offering to
        complete the user sign-in and persistent trolley database.
